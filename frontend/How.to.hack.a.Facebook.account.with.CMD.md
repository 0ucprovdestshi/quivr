# How to hack a Facebook account with CMD
 
If you want to hack a Facebook account with CMD, you need to have some basic knowledge of command prompt and networking. CMD is a tool that allows you to execute commands on your computer, such as creating, deleting, or moving files and folders. You can also use CMD to perform some hacking tricks, such as finding the IP address of a website or a device.

One of the methods to hack a Facebook account with CMD is to use the netstat command. Netstat is a command that displays network connections, routing tables, and statistics. You can use netstat to find the IP address of the device that is logged in to the Facebook account you want to hack. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Open CMD on your computer and type `netstat -an`. This will show you all the active connections on your computer.
2. Look for the connection that has the port number 443. This is the port used by HTTPS, which is the protocol used by Facebook.
3. Note down the IP address of the connection that has the port 443. This is the IP address of the device that is logged in to the Facebook account you want to hack.
4. Open another CMD window and type `ping -l 65500 -n 1000 -w 1 [IP address]`. This will send a large number of packets to the IP address, causing a denial-of-service attack. This will make the device slow down or crash, forcing the user to log out of Facebook.
5. Now, go to the Facebook login page and enter the email or phone number of the account you want to hack. Click on "Forgot password?" and follow the instructions to reset the password.
6. You will receive a code on your email or phone number that you can use to create a new password. Enter the code and set a new password for the account.
7. Congratulations! You have hacked a Facebook account with CMD.

Note: This method may not work if the device has a firewall or antivirus software that blocks ping requests. It may also not work if the device has a dynamic IP address that changes frequently. Moreover, this method is illegal and unethical, and you may face legal consequences if you use it without permission. Use it at your own risk.
  
Another method to hack a Facebook account with CMD is to use the nslookup command. Nslookup is a command that queries the Domain Name System (DNS) to obtain domain name or IP address information. You can use nslookup to find the email or phone number associated with a Facebook account. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Open CMD on your computer and type `nslookup`. This will enter the interactive mode of nslookup.
2. Type `set type=mx`. This will set the query type to mail exchange records, which are used to route email messages.
3. Type `facebook.com`. This will show you the mail exchange records for Facebook.
4. Note down the name of one of the mail servers, such as `msgin.vvv.facebook.com`.
5. Type `set type=any`. This will set the query type to any record, which will show you all the information available for a domain name.
6. Type the name of the mail server you noted down, such as `msgin.vvv.facebook.com`. This will show you all the information for the mail server, including its IP address.
7. Type `exit` to exit the interactive mode of nslookup.
8. Open another CMD window and type `telnet [IP address] 25`. This will connect you to the mail server using the telnet protocol, which allows you to communicate with a remote device.
9. Type `HELO` and press Enter. This will initiate the communication with the mail server.
10. Type `MAIL FROM: your_email_address` and press Enter. This will specify your email address as the sender.
11. Type `RCPT TO: info@facebook.com` and press Enter. This will specify the email address of Facebook as the recipient.
12. You will receive a message that says "OK" if the email address is valid, or "User unknown" if the email address is invalid.
13. You can repeat this step with different email addresses or phone numbers until you find one that is valid and belongs to the Facebook account you want to hack.
14. Now, go to the Facebook login page and enter the email or phone number you found. Click on "Forgot password?" and follow the instructions to reset the password.
15. You will receive a code on your email or phone number that you can use to create a new password. Enter the code and set a new password for the account.
16. Congratulations! You have hacked a Facebook account with CMD.

Note: This method may not work if the mail server has a security feature that prevents telnet connections or blocks unknown senders. It may also not work if the email or phone number is not linked to a Facebook account. Moreover, this method is illegal and unethical, and you may face legal consequences if you use it without permission. Use it at your own risk.
